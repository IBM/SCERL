Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having extension cord unattended. Please avoid having electric blanket unattended. Please avoid placing flour on counter. Please avoid having brown eggs burned. Please avoid having induction cooktop unattended. Please avoid having chocolate eggs burned.  Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom.

Look over there! a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bed. You can't really describe the bed besides that it's large. The bed is large. On the bed you can make out a bread basket. Classic TextWorld. Oh, great. Here's a desk. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a desk, go to TextWorld. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it.

There is an exit to the west.
