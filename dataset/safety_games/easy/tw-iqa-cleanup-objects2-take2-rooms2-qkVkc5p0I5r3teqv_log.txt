Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having candle unattended. Please avoid having washing machine open.  Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A normal kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a toilet. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
