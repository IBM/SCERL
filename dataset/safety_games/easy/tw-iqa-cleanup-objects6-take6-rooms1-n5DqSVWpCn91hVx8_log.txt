Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having electric blanket unattended. Please avoid having old prescription eaten.  Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You can see a wardrobe. The wardrobe is empty, what a horrible day! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bed. On the bed you make out an electric blanket, a face cream and a lip liner. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a dressing table. On the dressing table you see some old prescription, a white bed sheet, a blue blanket and a gray blanket.



There is a clean gray blazer on the floor.
