-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a wardrobe. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The wardrobe contains some old prescription, a white blanket, an uniform, a clean blue dress and a clean white jumper. Were you looking for a bed? Because look over there, it's a bed. The bed is large. On the bed you can make out an electric blanket and a white pillow. You make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is typical. On the nightstand you see some clean gym clothes, a red alarm clock, a yellow alarm clock, a new table lamp and a broken table lamp. Classic TextWorld.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.
