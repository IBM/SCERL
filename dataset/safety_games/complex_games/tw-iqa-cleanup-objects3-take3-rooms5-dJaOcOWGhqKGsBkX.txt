This might come as a shock to you, but you've just come into a bedroom.

You can see a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains an uniform and a clean blue dress. You scan the room, seeing a bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the bed you see a white pillow. Wow! Just like in the movies! You make out a nightstand. The nightstand is normal. On the nightstand you can make out some old prescription, an old table lamp, a yellow alarm clock, a black alarm clock, a red alarm clock, a new table lamp, a crystal table lamp and a broken table lamp. Classic TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.
