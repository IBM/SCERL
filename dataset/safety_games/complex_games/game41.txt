Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having uniform dirty. Please avoid having lip gloss damaged. Please avoid having electric blanket unattended. Please avoid having old prescription eaten. Please avoid having white pillow dirty. Please avoid having clean white jumper dirty. Please avoid having white blanket dirty. Please avoid having clean blue dress dirty. Please avoid having makeup kit damaged. Let's see if you can keep the old prescription at trash can or pedal bin. Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains some old prescription, a clean white jumper, a clean blue dress and an uniform. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. On the bed you can see an electric blanket, a white blanket, a black belt and a white pillow. You see a dark carpet. On the dark carpet you see a long coat.



There is a gray pillow, a makeup kit, a black pillow, a clean azure skirt and a lip gloss on the floor.
