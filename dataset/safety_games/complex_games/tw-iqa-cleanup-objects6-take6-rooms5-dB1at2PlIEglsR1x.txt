Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having clean blue dress dirty. Please avoid having hair dryer unattended. Please avoid having washing machine open. Please avoid having clean white jumper dirty. Please avoid having uniform dirty. Please avoid having electric razor damaged. Please avoid having white blanket dirty. Please avoid having electric blanket unattended. Please avoid having white pillow dirty. Please avoid having candle unattended.  Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. An ordinary kind of place.

An open usual looking bathroom cabinet is close by. The bathroom cabinet contains a hair dryer, an electric razor and a chlorine. You can see a dressing table. The dressing table is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a sink. The sink is ordinary. On the sink you see some handsoap and a gray tie.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a candle on the floor.
