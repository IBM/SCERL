Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having broken table lamp damaged. Please avoid having red alarm clock damaged. Please avoid having clean white jumper dirty. Please avoid having crystal table lamp damaged. Please avoid having black alarm clock damaged. Please avoid having old prescription eaten. Please avoid having yellow alarm clock damaged. Please avoid having old table lamp damaged. Please avoid having clean blue dress dirty. Please avoid having white blanket dirty. Please avoid having drill unattended. Please avoid having new table lamp damaged.

Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom.

You see a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a clean blue dress, a white blanket, an uniform and a clean white jumper. You make out a bed. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a nightstand. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The nightstand is ordinary. On the nightstand you see some old prescription, a new table lamp, a broken table lamp, a red alarm clock, a crystal table lamp, a black alarm clock, a yellow alarm clock and an old table lamp. Classic TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.
