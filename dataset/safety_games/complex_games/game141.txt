Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having fridge open. Please avoid having apron dirty. Please avoid having rat poison eaten. Please avoid having chicken wing burned. Please avoid having fridge open. Please avoid having mixer unattended. Please avoid placing handsoap in fridge. Please avoid having extension cord unattended. Please avoid placing laundry detergent in fridge. Please avoid placing rotten red tuna in fridge. Please avoid having pork chop burned. Please avoid having fridge open. Please avoid having rotten red potato eaten. Let's see if you can get the chicken wing cooked. Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Corridor =-
You're now in a corridor.

You see a coat hanger. The coat hanger is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
