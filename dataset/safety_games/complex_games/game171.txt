Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having fridge open. Please avoid having dirty mug cleaned. Please avoid placing washing powder in fridge. Please avoid having rotten green apple eaten. Please avoid having apron dirty. Please avoid having space heater unattended. Please avoid having white golf shoes dirty. Please avoid having hiking boots damaged. Please avoid placing laundry detergent in fridge. Please avoid placing handsoap in fridge.  Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty typical here.

You make out a closed fridge nearby. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains a lettuce. You see an opened dishwasher. What a letdown! The dishwasher is empty! You see a dining table. You see a washing powder on the dining table. Wow! Just like in the movies!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is an apron, a laundry detergent and some handsoap on the floor.
