Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having electric blanket unattended. Please avoid having washing machine open. Please avoid having uniform dirty. Please avoid having space heater unattended. Please avoid having white pillow dirty. Please avoid having drill unattended. Please avoid having extension cord unattended. Please avoid having storage chest open. Please avoid having clean white jumper dirty. Please avoid having white blanket dirty.  Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Corridor =-
You find yourself in a corridor. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see an umbrella stand. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a drill on the floor.
