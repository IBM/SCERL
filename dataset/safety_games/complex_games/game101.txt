Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having fridge open. Please avoid having candle unattended. Please avoid having white golf shoes dirty. Please avoid having storage chest open. Please avoid having rotten red potato eaten. Please avoid having pork chop burned. Please avoid having fridge open. Please avoid placing toaster in fridge. Please avoid having hair dryer unattended. Please avoid placing laundry detergent in fridge. Let's see if you can keep the teapot at kitchen cupboard. Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Livingroom =-
Well, here we are in a livingroom.

You see a storage chest. Hmmm... what else, what else? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. On the sofa you see a clean salad spinner. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a coffee table. The coffee table appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the south.

There is a candle and a pair of white golf shoes on the floor.
