-= Pantry =-
You've just shown up in a pantry.

You scan the room, seeing a folding chair. On the folding chair you make out a red apple, a clean cup and a corkscrew. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can see a shelf. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The shelf is wooden. On the shelf you can see some yellow eggs, a green hot pepper and some new eggs, so there's that.

There is an open plain door leading east.
