-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.

You make out a closed fridge. You make out a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains a kettle, a blender, some eggs, some flour, some rat poison, a saucepan, a laundry detergent, a dirty mesh skimmer, an apron and a chopping board. You can make out a dishwasher. The dishwasher contains a plate. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a drill and a fire hydrant. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.



There is an extension cord, a toaster, a candle, a hair dryer, an induction cooktop, a rotten green apple, a rotten red tuna, a rotten red potato, a washing powder and some handsoap on the floor.
