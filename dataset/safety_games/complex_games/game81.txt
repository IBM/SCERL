-= Kitchen =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a kitchen.

You can see a fridge. You can see a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains some flour, some rat poison, a mixer and a chopping board. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Oh, great. Here's a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you see a white tuna, a white onion, a clean mug, a clean salad spinner and an used plastic cup. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!



There is a drill, a candle, a hair dryer, an induction cooktop, a rotten red tuna, a plate, a washing powder, a toaster and a laundry detergent on the floor.
