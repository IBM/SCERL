-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a wardrobe. Huh, weird. The wardrobe contains a clean white jumper. You see a bed. The bed is large. On the bed you can make out a white coat, a white pillow and a white blanket. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a desk. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the desk.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.
