Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having extension cord unattended. Please avoid having space heater unattended. Please avoid having crystal table lamp damaged. Please avoid having broken table lamp damaged. Please avoid having old table lamp damaged. Please avoid having candle unattended. Please avoid having electric blanket unattended. Please avoid having drill unattended.  Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Corridor =-
You've just shown up in a corridor.

You can see a key holder. The key holder is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can make out an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a candle and a notebook on the floor.
