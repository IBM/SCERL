-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. An ordinary one.

You see an opened bathroom cabinet here. The bathroom cabinet contains a nail polish. You can make out a toilet. You shudder, but continue examining the toilet. The toilet is white. The toilet appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the toilet! oh well.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a mouthwash, a towel, a dirty blue jumper, a face cream, an electric razor, a chlorine, some handsoap and some shampoo on the floor.
