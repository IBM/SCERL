-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Look over there! a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains some rat poison, a mixer, a wooden spoon and a chopping board. You can make out a cutlery drawer. The cutlery drawer is empty! What a waste of a day! You scan the room for a dining table, and you find a dining table. The dining table appears to be empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

There is an induction cooktop, a candle, a pork chop, a rotten red tuna, a cushion, a toaster, a dictionary and a plate on the floor.
