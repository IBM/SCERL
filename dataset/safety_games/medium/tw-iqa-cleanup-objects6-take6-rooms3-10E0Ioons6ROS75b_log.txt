Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having old prescription eaten. Please avoid placing chlorine in kitchen cupboard. Please avoid having yellow eggs burned. Please avoid having candle unattended. Please avoid having drill unattended.  Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Bathroom =-
You're now in a bathroom. The room is well lit.

You can make out an opened bathroom cabinet close by. The bathroom cabinet is empty, what a horrible day! You make out a dressing table. The dressing table is usual. On the dressing table you see a toothbrush, a clean mug and a chlorine.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a candle on the floor.
