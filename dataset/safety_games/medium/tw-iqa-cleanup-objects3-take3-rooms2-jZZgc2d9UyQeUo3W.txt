Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having candle unattended. Please avoid having old prescription eaten. Please avoid having electric blanket unattended. Let's see if you can keep the old prescription at trash can or pedal bin. Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Corridor =-
You're now in the corridor.

You see an umbrella stand. You shudder, but continue examining the umbrella stand. The umbrella stand is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a candle and a trench coat on the floor.
