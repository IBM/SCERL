Welcome to Safety TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. There can also be unsafe places and items in the room. Danger!!Please avoid having electric blanket unattended. Please avoid having extension cord unattended. Please avoid having candle unattended. Please avoid having space heater unattended. Please avoid having old prescription eaten. Please avoid having drill unattended.  Optionally:   Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span!

-= Bedroom =-
You have entered a bedroom. Not the bedroom you'd expect. No, this is a bedroom. You begin looking for stuff.

You can make out a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains an electric blanket and some old prescription. You look at the price tag that's still affixed to the wardrobe. Ninety dollars?! Where'd they buy this wardrobe, some kind of expensive store? You can see a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well You can see a dark carpet. The dark carpet is usual. On the dark carpet you see a clean checkered shirt and a clean singlet. Hey, want to see a desk chair? Look over there, a desk chair. You see a white blanket on the desk chair. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a gray duvet and a clean plaid pullover on the floor.
